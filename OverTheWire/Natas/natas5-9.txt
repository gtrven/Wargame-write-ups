	problem: you come across a page saying "access denied, you are not logged in." 

	answer: fire up burpsuite as a proxy again, and then re load the page, you'll see a value "loggedin:0" (0=false), lets try changing that to a 1, then forwarding the request

	password: aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1

	what-I-learned: again, burp suite is a powerful set of tools for web application pentesting, and using it as a proxy is helpful.

	problem: you come across a page that requires a secret to obtain the password. looking at the source shows php code that checks for a secret, however its contained in a variable so this isn't helpful

	answer: you'll notice it includes /includes/secret.inc. browse to the file, and then view its source, and you have the secret you need to enter!

	password: 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9 

	what-I-learned: be sure to investigate further if possible, and just be curious.

	problem: You are faced with a home page, and an about page, in the source one of them will tell you where the password is.

	answer:	this webserver is has a LFI vulnerability that you can use to check other files on the system, including the one where the password is stored.
 	example: URL_here/../../../path_to_file

	problem: you come across another "input secret" page, so lets view the source. 

	answer: you'll notice that $secret, is base64 encoded, so lets use php to do the reverse of this. you'll get your secret after that.

	problem: we see a page "find words containing __". so lets look at the source

	answer: you'll notice it's running the linux command "grep" on the server, so this should be vulnerable to command injection.
 	enter " pass; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10."
